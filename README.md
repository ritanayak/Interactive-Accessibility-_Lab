1. What accessibility enhancements were the most challenging to implement, and why?

The most challenging part was understanding when to use ARIA versus semantic HTML. Overusing ARIA can cause accessibility issues, so learning to rely on native HTML elements first required careful consideration.

2. How do ARIA attributes improve the experience for users relying on assistive technologies?

ARIA attributes provide additional context to screen readers, such as announcing dynamic content updates (aria-live) and clearly associating labels and sections, improving navigation and usability for assistive technology users.

3. What tools did you use to check color contrast, and how did they help?

Tools like the WebAIM Contrast Checker were used to verify text contrast ratios. These tools helped ensure the text met WCAG guidelines, improving readability for users with low vision or color blindness.
